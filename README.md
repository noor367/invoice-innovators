# invoice-innovators

## Overview

A collaborative university project for the seng2021 course. Invoice Innovators is an invoice management service aimed towards small to medium businesses to address all their invoicing needs.

I elected to not include the backend API since I was not the only one who worked on it. However, I did build the frontend.

## Contents

`frontend-vanilla` folder includes the initial static index html file, css styling (and bootstrap), and javascript files.

- This was to provide a relatively basic prototype of how the final frontend would look

`frontend-react` folder contains the files for the React.js web app version of the website, created with `create-react-app`.

- This was a high-fidelity prototype for the project, using important elements of UI/UX design. However due to time constraints, the website may appear overly simple, without branding that seems unique to Invoice Innovators

## Context

The Invoice Innovatorâ€™s e-invoicing service offers a very easy-to-use, reasonably priced application with all the necessary functionality for small business owners to adapt to using and sending off e-invoices. Since there is an impending legal requirement for small to medium Australian businesses to switch completely to paper-free invoices, the purpose of our solution is to present itself as the most convenient, intuitive and efficient choice for small business owners who do not have the time, money or excess effort to invest in the current services available on the market.

- Own invoice rendering API
- Use of other class group's invoice creation and invoice validation APIs
